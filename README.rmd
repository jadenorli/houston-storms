# Contents

This repository contains an analysis of potential locations within the
Economic Exclusion Zones (EEZ) along the West Coast of the US that are
potentially suitable locations for integrative multi-trophic aquaculture
(IMTA).

# Techniques

This repository highlights a variety of skills and techniques including:

1.  Data Management
    -   Wrangling and tidying data using [@tidyverse], [@here], and
        [@janitor]

    -   Visualizations with [@ggplot2] and [@tmap]

    -   Clear documentation and folder structures for reproducibility,
        collaboration, and modularity

    -   Integration of conditional statements and custom checks to
        increase reproducibility, error handling, and modularity

    -   Development of generalizable functions to allow for
        reproducibility and flexibility in analyses
2.  Geospatial Analysis
    -   Handling spatial data with [@terra] and [@sf]
    -   Generating informative interactive maps with [@tmap]
    -   Map algebra with spatial objects within [@terra] and [@sf]
3.  Sustainable Fisheries Science
    -   Adapting concepts from [@gentry2017] and [@troell2009] to
        analyze potential locations within the West Coast EEZs that are
        suitable for integrative multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) with
        oysters and a variety of potential finfish species

    -   Integration of flexible species-specific tolerances throughout
        the spatial analyses
